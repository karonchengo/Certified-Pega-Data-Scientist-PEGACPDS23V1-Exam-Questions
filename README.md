<h1>Detailed Breakdown of Exam Topics</h1>

<h3>AI for Customer Decision Hub (8%)</h3>

<p>This section covers how Pega&#39;s Customer Decision Hub enables organizations to deliver personalized customer experiences. The focus is on using AI to provide real-time predictions and decisions that drive meaningful customer interactions. You&rsquo;ll need to understand how Pega&#39;s predictions fit within decision strategies.</p>

<h3>Adaptive Analytics (22%)</h3>

<p>Adaptive analytics deals with self-learning models that continuously evolve based on new data. As a test-taker, you&rsquo;ll learn how to build and monitor adaptive models to ensure they stay accurate over time. Another critical aspect is exporting model data to track performance and feed external analytics tools.</p>

<h3>Predictive Analytics (26%)</h3>

<p>Predictive analytics involves forecasting future events based on past trends and patterns. In this section, you&rsquo;ll focus on how to create predictions using Pega&rsquo;s tools and integrate them with decision-making processes. A crucial part of this topic is MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), which ensures that models are maintained and deployed efficiently.</p>

<h3>Prediction Patterns (20%)</h3>

<p>Prediction patterns help in organizing and defining decision-making strategies. In this area, candidates must demonstrate their ability to design and implement decision strategies that align with business goals. A deep understanding of prediction patterns ensures accurate forecasting and customer engagement.</p>

<h3>Governance (2%)</h3>

<p>Governance ensures that AI models and decisions comply with business policies and industry regulations. Though this section carries a small weight, it is vital for ensuring the responsible use of AI in data-driven processes.</p>

<h3>Pega Process AI (8%)</h3>

<p>Pega Process AI is designed to automate workflows and predict potential disruptions, such as fraud detection or missed SLAs (Service-Level Agreements). This topic tests your ability to use AI in operational processes to enhance efficiency and reduce risks.</p>

<h3>Pega NLP (14%)</h3>

<p>NLP (Natural Language Processing) allows Pega to interpret unstructured data, like text from emails or chat messages. In this section, you&rsquo;ll need to understand how to use text analytics for routing emails and entity extraction with chatbots to enhance customer service interactions.</p>
